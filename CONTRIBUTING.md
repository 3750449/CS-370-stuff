ü§ù Simple Contribution Guide
Welcome! To keep our code clean, fast, and secure, please follow these three core standards.

1. Security & Data
   Protect the System and User Data.

Passwords: NEVER store passwords in plain text. Always use bcrypt (or a similar strong hashing library) on the server before saving them to the database.

Access Control: All data changes (upload, edit, delete) must be handled by the Node.js server, and the server MUST verify the user is logged in and authorized to perform that specific action (Role-Based Access Control).

File Integrity: Validate all file uploads on the server (check if the file content is actually a PDF) and store them using a random, secure filename outside the web execution path (in Google Cloud Storage).

Injection Prevention: Use an ORM (like Sequelize) for all database queries to prevent SQL injection.

2. Frontend & Design
   Focus on Speed and Mobile Experience.

Mobile-First Design: The application must look and function perfectly on mobile screens first. Use Tailwind CSS responsive classes (sm:, md:, etc.) for every layout.

Modern React: Use only functional components and standard React Hooks (useState, useEffect). Keep components small and reusable.

3. Coding Style (Readability & Consistency)
   Write code that is easy for others to read and maintain.

Variable Naming: Use camelCase for variables, functions, and component names (e.g., uploadFile, userName). Use PascalCase for React components (e.g., FileCard).

Constants: Use screaming snake case (ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE) for global constants (e.g., MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB).

Formatting Tool: Use Prettier to automatically format code after every commit. Do not argue with Prettier's settings.

Comments: Use comments to explain the why (complex logic, business rules), not the what (what obvious code is doing).

Function Length: Keep functions and methods focused. If a function is longer than about 50 lines, it probably needs to be broken down.

4. Code Quality & Workflow
   Maintain Consistency and Review.

Linter Use: Run the code formatter (Prettier) and linter (ESLint) before every commit to ensure consistent style and catch simple errors.

Async/Await: Use async/await for all asynchronous operations in both the frontend and backend.

Testing: New features require basic tests to ensure they work as intended.

Pull Requests (PRs): Use clear commit titles (e.g., feat: Add PDF tagging UI) and get at least one review before merging code.
